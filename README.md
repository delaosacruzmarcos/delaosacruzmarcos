# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As an embedded programer with a curiosity for higher level frameworks I have an (overly) abitious amount of projects I want to implement. 

1. Build a website to host my projects on and for referals
2. "Productionize" the assembly 2048 game I made with my friend liam mullen in college
3. Build an obsidian pluggin that parses C++ repository into a graph to visualize dependencies
4. Work on the "Crew play along" app idea with modern development techniques

## Thanks for watching me work :)
